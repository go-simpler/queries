# queries

[WIP] Convenience helpers for working with SQL queries.

## Features

- `Builder`: an `fmt`-based query builder with an API similar to `strings.Builder`.
- `Scanner`: a query-to-struct scanner, a lightweight version of `sqlx` with a smaller and stricter API.

## Usage

See [examples](example_test.go).
